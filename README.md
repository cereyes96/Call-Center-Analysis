# Call-Center-Analysis
In this personal project, I used a public dataset on call center data to analyze the metrics and determine their relationship with customer satisfaction

## Scenario
An initial analysis was done regarding the business's performance during the month of October. This analysis was made in order to build a dashboard that showcased KPI's such as call flow, sentiment, states where the customers contacted from, channel of contact, etc. 
The company's operations manager analyzed the report and dashboard created by the analytics team, but noticed that one of the key metrics was not included, which was the customer satisfaction scores. This metric is a key indicator of how well the customer support team is performing and tells us how satisfied are our customers with the service provided.
With this in mind, he decided to assign me the task to perform a new analysis focused on the customer satisfaction scores registered by the surveys at the end of each interaction. Also, he requested that each performance metric was compared with the customer satisfaction scores in order to determine any relationships between them and identify outliers or factors that affect the customer satisfaction scores directly. 
Aside from the analysis, our manager requested a presentation and a report that included the following:
- A log of all the transformations done to the original dataset
- An Excel file containing the analysis
- A new dashboard that includes visualizations of the analysis
- Observations based on the analysis
